## User stories for MVP
I can log into my own account via a form on the front page of the site, or by accessing a login screen via a button on the splash page.

I can see a feed of all the dreams that everyone has posted.

I can see my own feed of all the dreams I myself have posted. I can access this page via a link on the main feed.

I can see a page that shows a single dream. I can access this page by clicking on a link on the main dream feed or on my own dream feed.

I can create a new dream on a page, dragging and dropping files into an upload box and adding text as needed. I can rearrange various blocks of content.

I can delete a dream.

I can edit a dream by pressing an "edit" button.


## Steps towards MVP

Wednesday: Have Rails API up and running and have serializers in place.

Thursday: It's Thanksgiving I'm not doing anything

Friday: Create initial components on React frontend, solidifying parent-child relationships. Get front page and user page up and running. Potentially begin with routes.

Saturday: Finish routing and have dream creating page in place, with at least a text entry box. Have entries persisting to back end and showing up on main app page and personal page.

Sunday: Try to get photos and audio uploading - but this could take a while!
